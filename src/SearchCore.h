// SearchCore.h
// Search options, results, and the search operations that need no editor view:
// Find/Replace in Files, Find in Projects, and replacing in a string. Foundation
// only, so the headless tests (ctest) can link it without AppKit. SearchEngine
// (SearchEngine.h) adds the operations on a ScintillaView.
//
// Every operation runs the editor's engine: Find in Files loads each file into
// a headless Scintilla Document and searches it with the same flags, the same
// Boost.Regex backend and the same loops as a tab (see regex/NppBufferSearch.h).
